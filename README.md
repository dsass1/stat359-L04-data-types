## Overview

The goal of this lab is to learn about the different data types. In particular, how to deal with factors, dates, and time in R, specifically within the tidyverse (although many of these methods can be applied with base R functions as well). 

- Factors are used to work with categorical variables, or variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. We'll use the `forcats` package, which provides tools for dealing with categorical variables. 
- The `lubridate` package makes it easier to work with dates and times within R in an intuitive framework with methods that can handle time zones, leap days, daylight savings times, and other issues related to time.

* [`lubridate` vignette (highly recommend)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html)

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L04_data_types.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L04.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
